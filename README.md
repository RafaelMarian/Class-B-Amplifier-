# Class-B Amplifier Project

## Overview

This project, presented during my second year of study, focused on replicating the fundamental functionality of a Class-B amplifier using MATLAB. The primary aim was to understand and simulate the operation of a Class-B amplifier, showcasing its output characteristics in response to a specified input waveform. The project also involved gathering data on power efficiency and overall amplifier efficiency.

## Technical Aspects

### Class-B Amplifier Functionality
- **Purpose:** The Class-B amplifier operates by amplifying only half of the input signal cycle, ensuring efficiency by allowing each amplifying element to function for half the input waveform cycle.
- **Biasing:** This amplifier class typically employs a push-pull configuration to allow for the amplification of both positive and negative halves of the input signal.
- **Reduction of Cross-over Distortion:** Special circuitry or techniques are employed to minimize the distortion that occurs at the crossover point where the two half-cycles meet.

### MATLAB Simulation
