# Class-B-Amplifier-

I successfully presented this project in my second year of study. The main goal of this project was to
replicate in MatLab the basic functionality of a class B amplifier. With the help of Matlab, I've highlighted
the output characteristics for a given input waveform and registered different data about power and
overall efficiency.
